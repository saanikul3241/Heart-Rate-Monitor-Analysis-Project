**Heart Rate Monitor**

Patient heart rate (HR) is utilized as an indicator of health in the medical field due to the efficiency and affordability of heart rate monitors. Recent advancements have utilized pulse plethysmography (PPG) to obtain real-world HR measurements as compared to the traditional ECG methodology. The aim of this project is to compare our designed heart rate monitor circuit to assess the accuracy of pulse oximetry PPG technology as well as provide a construction for heart rate measurement outside of clinical settings. 

**Methodology** HRs of both subjects measured as samples 3x. Pulse rate from circuit measured by fingertip over infrared LED QED-123 and infrared transistor QSD-123. Pulse rate from pulse oximeter measured in traditional method, with measurement accuracy determined by percentage difference. 

The provided MATLAB files illustrate spectral analysis to confirm the efficacy of constructed circuit, with peaks within expected human pulse rate range for both subjects. Bandpass filtering output confirms efficiency of signal processing with reduced noise levels in data. Values ranged from 56-69 beats per minute (BPM) for Subject 1 (saani) and 83-89 BPM for Subject 2.
